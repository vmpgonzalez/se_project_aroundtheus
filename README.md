Around the U.S Project

This project is an interactive webpage it was designed to showcase six images. This website features a user profile section where they can edit their name and add a brief description. I used HTML to code the structure of the webpage and CSS for styling as well as Javascript for user interactions and form validation. Users can interact with the webpage by liking images, editing images, and previewing images. Popups with smooth transitions were used to help the user edit their profile info, add new images, and previewing images thus making it a more enjoyable experience.
